This is the frontend used in ln2tbtc.com, it's a simple typescript react app that uses web3 to perform any client actions needed for the swap.

## Development
This was created with `create-react-app` so all the common basic commands are available:
```bash
npm install # Install dependencies
npm start # Start development server
npm test # Run tests
npm run build # Build page for deployment
```

## Deployment
This page is automatically built and deployed to Github Pages on every commit to `master` through a Github CI workflow.
